  <h1>Backpacking in Kathmandu</h1>
  <br>
  <p class="lead">People who visit Kathmandu are usually divided in two camps, 1 camp thinks it’s hectic and crowded and the other camps think that it’s a very nice and relaxed place. I’m in the latter camp, I agree there’s a lot of traffic and people but compared to Indian cities it’s peaceful. Anyway, there's a very big change you start your Nepalese journey in Kathmandu. It can be a bit daunting at first but eventually you will find your way here. To make the most of your time in Nepal read our tips below. </p>

<h4>Durbar Square</h4>
<p>Kathmandu’s most famous square with beautiful historic sights. Most of the sights got heavily damaged in the 2015 earthquake but it’s still worth a visit. A lot of backpackers go here to spot the Raj Kumari. A young girl chosen through an ancient selection process to become the human incarnation of the Hindu mother goddess called Durga. It’s a weird experience but check it out when you go to Durbar Square.</p>

          <br>
          <p>The best area to stay as a backpacker in Kathmandu is Thamel. In this area you will find a lot of hostels, hotels, restaurants and shops. With its narrow alleys and hippie vibes it’s a great place to meet other travelers or locals. Most of the hostels have a really relaxed vibe and great facilities. If you’re looking for a place to stay consider one of these options:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
          <li>Zostel Kathmandu <strong>&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;&#36;</span> | A very popular chain from India that now has hostels in Nepal. It's a bit more expensive but the hostel has great facilities.</li>

          <br>
          <p>There are great options for food in Kathmandu and it's possible to find almost every cuisine. For the best restaurants and cafés you’ve to be in Thamel. We selected a couple options if you’re out of ideas where to eat. </p>
          <br>

          <br>
          <li>Nirvana Cafe & Restaurant <strong>&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;&#36;</span> | <em>Nepalese & Western</em> | If you're going to the Swayambhunath Temple (Monkey Temple) try to go here as well.

          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></span> Budget Tips</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Backpacking in Nepal is really cheap. But still it would be nice to save some money. Down below you can find a couple tips to save money in Kathmandu. Want to know how much budget you need for backpacking in Nepal? Go visit our guide about the [budget you need for Nepal].</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Want to save money on food but still want a delicious meal? Go to Thamel Doner Kebab (as mentioned above). For just 200 NPR you can have a delicious Falaffel Wrap. </li>
            <br>
            <li>When you’re in Kathmandu and planning to do a multiday hike try to buy as much as possible in Thamel. Everywhere you can find stores to buy clothes you will need. In most stores it’s also possible to rent stuff, for example a sleeping bag is useful to rent instead of buying. Visit our guides about [stuff you need for a hike] or [preparing for a hike in Nepal] for more information.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If you want to go somewhere in the Kathmandu Valley on a budget go to Ratna Park Bus station. These local busses are quite an experience and a good way to save money compared to the more expensive tourist busses. See more information down below at the ‘getting around’ section. </li>
          </ul>
          <br>

        <div class="scrolladjust" id="gettingaround">
          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-road"></span> Getting around</h1>
          <br>
          <p>There are many options to get around in Kathmandu. It’s even possible to take a bike if you want to but with the heavy traffic it’s not recommended. The fastest way (and still can take  a while) is by taxi. The cheapest way are the local busses. </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Getting around by Taxi</h4>
          <p>The taxis in Kathmandu are not your average taxis, they’re extremely small and only fit about 2 people with 2 bags. Keep this in mind because it can cause a lot of inconvenience when you’re in a hurry. The taxis don’t have a meter. Even it’s not allowed by law but in general you’ve to bargain for your ride. In general a 15 min ride would cost you 300 NPR but it can varies a lot. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Duration from Thamel to popular destinations:</p>
          <ul class="nodeco">
          <li>Thamel <span class="glyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span> Swayambhunath Temple <em>15 min</em></li>
          <li>Thamel <span class="glyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span> Durbar Square <em>10 min</em></li>
          <li>Thamel <span class="glyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span> Bhaktapur <em>40 min</em></li>
          <li>Thamel <span class="glyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span> Patan <em>25 min</em></li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <br>
          <h4>Getting around by bus</h4>
          <p>Traveling by bus around Kathmandu is an experience. Definitely don’t go with the bus when you’re in a hurry. It can be very confusing and frustrating at times but if you want to connect with locals this is a good option for you. Usually the local busses don’t have signs with the destinations on them. So ask around for the bus to your destination. Once you’re in the right bus you pay to the conductor. In the local busses this is usually a young bloke who tries to lure more people in the bus. Because of this your journey can take a bit lounger but hey, it’s part of the experience.  </p>
          <p>Tourist busses are a lot more comfortable and straight forward. Although there’s a big difference in quality between different bus companies. Just go to the bus station of your destination and check the different bus companies. Usually they’re a couple busses waiting where you can choose from. </p>
        </div>
        <p>Down below you can find the bus stations for most destinations:</p>
        <ul class="nodeco">
        <li>Ratna Park Bus Station <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span> <em>Kathmandu Valley (Patan & Dhulikhel)</em></li>
