        <h1> Backpacking in Bhaktapur </h1>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">Despite the 2015 earthquake Bhaktapur is still an amazing town. It actually is the best preserved ancient Newa town in Nepal. When you’re exploring in Bhaktapur it feels like you’re going back in time. It’s possible to stay overnight in Bhaktapur and I strongly recommend it. At night and early morning Bhaktapur is a complete different town. Instead of tourists you can see the locals living their daily life. It’s one of the great experiences Nepal has to offer.</p>

              <h4>Bhaktapur Durbar Square</h4>
              <p>One of the four squares in Bhaktapur. It’s the main square of the town with beautiful temples. Everywhere you look you can find some outstanding craftsmanship. This is the perfect place to start diving into the Newari culture. <p>

              <h4>Nyatapola Temple</h4>
              <p>This temple is an eye catcher and you can see it from a far distance. It’s the highest temple in Bhaktapur and of the highest buildings in the Kathmandu Valley. Nyatapola means five stories and you instantly can see why the Newari called it like this. Unfortunately it’s only possible to go into the temple once a year during the Dashain festival. At the top of the stairs you’ve a great view of Bhaktapur. </p>

              <p>The best way to enjoy Pottery Square is to go here in the early morning, sit down and watch the world go by. You will see hundreds (thousands) of pots drying on the square and women working on them. It’s not the most beautiful square in Bhaktapur but definitely one of the more interesting ones.   </p>

          <br>
          <p>Staying in Bhaktapur can be a magical experience. Most accommodations are in Newari style and that makes it a unique experience. The downside is that it’s a bit more expensive. There are no hostels in Bhaktapur. One night is enough to enjoy all the sceneries in Bhaktapur but it wouldn't hurt to stay longer.</p>

          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></span> Budget Tips</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Backpacking in Nepal is really cheap. But still it would be nice to save some money. Down below you can find a couple tips to save money in Chitwan. Want to know how much budget you need for backpacking in Nepal? Go visit our guide about the [budget you need for Nepal].</p>
          <br>
          <p>The main activity in Chitwan is Wildlife spotting. Because accommodation and food is generally cheap this will be the thing you can save money on. There are a couple things you’ve to keep in mind when you’re booking a trip:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>No matter how big a group is there always need to be at least 2 guides joining a group. Always ask for the size of the group when you book and make sure you won’t be the only one in the group.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It doesn't matter what kind of trip you do you will always see wildlife. Jeep tours are a lot more expensive than hiking through the park. So to save money it’s better to hike through the park. Most of the time there will be a boat ride included. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Permits of the park are usually included in the total price of a tour (2000 NPR for foreigners). If you decide to get them yourself it’s smart to book them a day before your trip. They are only valid for one day but if you book the ticket the day before your trip after 2 PM it’s possible to do an afternoon tour on the same permit.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The best and cheapest tours are offered with the local guesthouses. The general rule is: the cheaper your accommodation the cheaper the tour will be. </li>
          </ul>
          <br>

        <div class="scrolladjust" id="gettingaround">
          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-road"></span> Getting around</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Sauraha is a small town so most distances can be covered by foot but it’s possible to rent a bike. If you book your accommodation in advance most guesthouses will pick you up once you arrive on the bus station.  </p>
