  <h1>Backpacking in Chitwan</h1>
  <br>
  <p class="lead">The best place in Nepal to go on a safari is Chitwan National Park. It’s possible to see Elephants, Tigers, Rhino’s, Sloth Bears and even Leopards. Chitwan is famous for the Rhinos that inhabit the park. They sometimes even roam around the villages at the border of the park and you can encounter them on the streets.The massive 932 km² that Chitwan has to offer can be explored by canoe, jeep or on foot. </p>

<h4>Chitwan by Foot</h4>
<p>Jungle walks in Chitwan are one of the best ways to come close to wildlife. Still there’s a change that you won’t see anything. Especially when the vegetation is high you will struggle to see wildlife. According to the rules there always need to be at least 2 guides joining you. Most accommodations offer guided tours. Usually they will be a combination between a boat tour and a jungle walk.</p>

<h4>Chitwan by Canoe</h4>
<p>Meandering through Chitwan National Park is the Rapti River. The best way to see wildlife (the whole year around) is to do a canoe trip on the river. In and around the river you can see all kinds of animals. One of the most extraordinary ones are the Gharial Crocodiles. There’s a big change you will see them on the banks of the river. Most of the time a Canoe trip is combined with a jungle walk or Jeep ride.</p>

<h4>Chitwan by Jeep </h4>
<p>Exploring Chitwan with a 4WD is a more comfortable way of enjoying the park. Also, you can go further in the park where there are less tourists. The animals are quite used to the jeeps so you still have a change to see wildlife. Most tour operators offer half day trips with 10-12 people on a jeep. </p>

<h4>Chitwan by Elephant?</h4>
<p>
It’s possible to do Elephant rides in Chitwan. If you’re considering this, please reconsider! As in most Asian countries Elephants are kept in atrocious conditions. Try instead to spot a wild elephant and not one that’s held in captivity. </p>

          <p>The backpacker area in Chitwan is the village of Sauraha. A classic Nepali Village that has turned into a hub for backpackers, luckily without losing its charm. In Sauraha you can find all kind of accommodations. Some of them are special and fit in with the nature that Chitwan has to offer. </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
          <li>Evergreen Ecolodge <strong>&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;&#36;</span> | My favorite accommodation in Chitwan. Cute small huts and outside showers make it a special concept. The whole area is green and provides a relaxed atmosphere. Together with their excellent food it will make you have a great stay in Chitwan.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Hotel Rhino Land <strong>&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;&#36;</span> | If you want a private room in Chitwan this is the best budget option. A great place to stay with great staff. It has a balcony which is a perfect spot to see some wildlife passing by. The hotel also offers tours for the park.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Hotel National Park <strong>&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;&#36;</span> | Spacious rooms in Nepali style. The food is great and the staff will help you arranging your plans for Chitwan. </li>

          <br>
          <p>In Sauraha it’s a bit harder to find a good place to eat compared to other destinations in Nepal. So most hostels/hotels will have a restaurant with excellent food. The restaurants with the best views are next to the river. Unfortunately got a lot of restaurants destroyed by a flooding in 2017. The restaurants down below are up and running.  </p>
          <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Sunset View Restaurant & Bar <strong>&#36;&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;</span> | <em>International</em> | A very cozy restaurant with great views of the river. Ofcourse a great place to watch the sunset and after that they usually have a bonfire. It’s also a great place to have a couple beers and talk about your Chitwan adventures. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Friends Cafe <strong>&#36;&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;</span> | <em>International</em> | Probably the best café in Sauraha. They serve all kinds of food and it always tastes great. With their great Wi-Fi it’s easy to spend a lot of time here when you’re in Sauraha.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Little Amsterdam <strong>&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;&#36;</span> | <em>International</em> |A bit of a hidden gem in Sauraha because it’s not located in the touristy area. But as a Dutchie I’ve to mention this place. It has a great atmosphere and lovely decorations. This place is a great opportunity if you want to try some Dutch snacks. </li>

          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></span> Budget Tips</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Backpacking in Nepal is really cheap. But still it would be nice to save some money. Down below you can find a couple tips to save money in Chitwan. Want to know how much budget you need for backpacking in Nepal? Go visit our guide about the [budget you need for Nepal].</p>
          <br>
          <p>The main activity in Chitwan is Wildlife spotting. Because accommodation and food is generally cheap this will be the thing you can save money on. There are a couple things you’ve to keep in mind when you’re booking a trip:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>No matter how big a group is there always need to be at least 2 guides joining a group. Always ask for the size of the group when you book and make sure you won’t be the only one in the group.</li>
            <br>
            <li>It doesn't matter what kind of trip you do you will always see wildlife. Jeep tours are a lot more expensive than hiking through the park. So to save money it’s better to hike through the park. Most of the time there will be a boat ride included. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Permits of the park are usually included in the total price of a tour (2000 NPR for foreigners). If you decide to get them yourself it’s smart to book them a day before your trip. They are only valid for one day but if you book the ticket the day before your trip after 2 PM it’s possible to do an afternoon tour on the same permit.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The best and cheapest tours are offered with the local guesthouses. The general rule is: the cheaper your accommodation the cheaper the tour will be. </li>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <p>Sauraha is a small town so most distances can be covered by foot but it’s possible to rent a bike. If you book your accommodation in advance most guesthouses will pick you up once you arrive on the bus station.  </p>
