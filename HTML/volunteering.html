<h1>Volunteering in Nepal</h1>
<br>
<p class="lead">Once you’re traveling in Nepal you will quickly adopt the feeling to give something back to the Nepalese people. It’s the best way to connect with locals and it’s very rewarding. The 2015 earthquake almost killed 9.000 people and Nepal is still recovering from this event. Besides this there are many possibilities to do volunteering in Nepal. We’re trying to help you to make a choice.</p>

  <h2>Where to start?</h2>
  <br>
  <p>If you’ve decided to volunteer in Nepal it’s smart to decide what kind of volunteering you want to do. This will depend on a couple things. These are some questions you can ask yourself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are you willing to pay money to volunteer?</li>
    <li>Can I help people in my own field of work?</li>
    <li>Do I want to volunteer for a family, local charity/NGO or international charity/NGO?</li>
    <li>For how long am I willing to volunteer?</li>
    <li>Where in Nepal do I want to volunteer?</li>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
    <br>

     <p class="thumbnail-text text-center small">Me looking like a giant compared to my host family.</p>
   </div>
    <p>Volunteering for free in Nepal is possible but before you decide this you’ve to consider a couple things. Nepal is a third world country and a lot of people are struggling to feed themselves. An extra mouth to feed for a family can be a struggle. If you’re on a budget and want to volunteer for free try to do this at least at a place that have sufficient funds to cover the costs. If you’re lucky they will provide you with accommodation and food. Online you can find a lot of places that offer free volunteering but this isn’t always completely free. Usually you’ve to book a tour or hike with them and then you can volunteer for free afterwards.  Like with a lot of things, the best places will be fully booked quick. So try to look for opportunities in advance.</p>
    <p> Willing to pay money for volunteering? Good, because this will give you the opportunity to volunteer at a family. Normally you will pay around $5 a day and food and accommodation will be included. So it won’t be very expensive. If you choose to volunteer for a big NGO the costs will vary a lot. There’re NGO’s where you can volunteer for free but also where you pay $50 a day. Most NGO’s provide all this information on their website.

    <p class="">If you want to help with one of your skills there are enough possibilities. For example teachers, carpenters, nurses will find it very easy to find a position. Don’t worry if you don’t have any of those skills. I didn’t have any of these skills and found it very easy to find a place. </p>
    <p>Basically you’ve 3 kinds of places where you can volunteer: a family, a local charity (for example an orphanage) or an international NGO. All have a different approach with their pros and cons. </p>
    <h3>1) Volunteering at a family</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite option because you will get very close with a family. I volunteered 3 weeks on a remote family farm and after those 3 weeks I felt like I was part of the family. They provided me with my own room and cooked the best Dal Bhat for me. Most families will give you a lot of freedom and let you do your own thing. After a while you start to learn some Nepalese and understand the culture. Families are also flexible so you can often start and stop whenever you want.</p>
    <p>A downside of volunteering at a family can be that you will be the only backpacker. Sometimes you want to share your experiences but there’s nobody you can share it with. Helping a family can be very rewarding but compared to the other options your contributions are smaller. You will only help one family instead of maybe hundreds if you work for a bigger program. </p>
    <p>On these website you can find families to volunteer <a href="https://www.helpx.net/">HelpX</a>,<a href="www.workaway.info"> Workaway</a>,<a href="https://hippohelp.com/"> Hippohelp</a>.</p>

    <td>Become part of a family</td>

  </tr>

  </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<h3>2) Volunteering at a local charity</h3>
<p>Local charities can be a wonderful place for volunteering. Think of teaching English at a school, help in an orphanage or train kids at the local football club. Compared to volunteering at a family you’re able to help larger groups of people. Usually you will do this together with other backpackers what makes it lots of fun. Accommodation will usually be arranged for you and if you’re lucky they will also provide you with meals. </p>
<p>Volunteering for large groups can be very challenging. Think ahead if you’re planning to do this. You often work with emotionally damaged people and this can bring a lot of pressure. If you’re willing to volunteer keep in mind that it needs a bit more planning. So try to plan ahead to get the best opportunities. </p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Opportunity to develop your own skills</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<h3>3) Volunteering at an international charity</h3>
<p>It doesn’t look as appealing to volunteer for an international charity but it does have a couple of benefits. Bigger charities usually work on bigger programs. A lot of them focus on rebuilding houses that have been damaged by the earthquake. So you will contribute a lot to the local communities. You will work in large groups and everyone has a specific task. Volunteering for a program like this will be hard work but a lot of fun. </p>
<p>A disadvantage of working for a bigger charity is that you’ve less freedom. And this can result that it feels like being on a job instead of volunteering. Also because you work mostly with foreigners you don’t have as much contact with locals. So if you want to learn about the Nepalese culture and language I suggest to look for small programs. </p>

<h2>My volunteering story</h2>

 <p class="thumbnail-text text-center small">Daily chanting of my host</p>
</div>
<p class="pull-left">I was a month in Nepal and I truly felt in love with the country. This country had given me so much pleasure that I wanted to give something back. I’m a big fan of nature but I also wanted to do something related to the earthquake. I heard other backpackers finding their volunteering places via de website HelpX. So I had a look on the website and quickly I found a family who had a farm and needed volunteers. The farm was completely destroyed by the earthquake and he was still rebuilding some parts of the farm. </p>
<p>The farm is located near Banepa. It was positioned on the top of a hill with a great view over the village but also over some parts of the Himalaya. The farm itself is surrounded by jungle. My host was Krishna, an inspiring man who was chanting every morning and night. My daily routine was to watch Krishna chant and then eat breakfast. The wife of Krishna made the most amazing meals with all ingredients straight from the farm. After breakfast we usually worked for about 6 hours. Every day we did something different on the farm: weeding, planting beans, making drainage systems, sorting soya beans and much more. It was never boring. My room was surprisingly well, it was a new build shed and I even had electricity for 6 hours a day. There was no running water and the toilet was just a hole in the ground. For drinking water we had to walk about 20 minutes to go to a spring. It was very basic but you start to appreciate the basic way of life. It was genuinely one of the best experiences I’ve ever had and I recommend everyone to at least do it once in your life. You’re basically part of a family and experience the true Nepal.</p>
