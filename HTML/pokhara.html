          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-bed"></span> Where to stay</h1>
          <br>
          <p>The best area to stay in Pokhara is Lakeside. Don’t even consider other areas because the rest of Pokhara is pretty hectic and dirty. Lakeside is a big contrast to the rest of the city, it’s clean, peaceful and you can find here the best accommodation. There aren't a lot of hostels in Pokhara. Most types of accomodation are guesthouses. A couple good places to stay in Lakeside are:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
          <li>Forest Lake Backpackers Hostel <strong>&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;&#36;</span> | One of the few real hostels in Pokhara. Really comfortable cabin beds. It's located next to the lake and has great views from the rooftop.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Hotel Eagle Zone <strong>&#36;&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;</span> | One of the hotels with great views over the lake. Fan of a good breakfast? This is your place to stay. Staff is friendly and helpfull.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The Mountain House <strong>&#36;&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;</span> | Guesthouse runned by a very helpful family. Spacious rooms for a great price. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <br>
        <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="../img/phewalake.jpg" alt="Phewa Lake">
        <div class="scrolladjust" id="food">
          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cutlery"></span> Food</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Lakeside is covered with great restaurants. There’re a lot of different nationalities in Pokhara so you can find all cuisines of the world here. They’re so many restaurants that it’s hard to make a selection. This are 3 places we really enjoyed during our stay. </p>
          <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Frituur No.1 <strong>&#36;&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;</span> | <em>Belgium fries & beers</em> | Want something else than Dal Bhat? This place has great Belgium fries and delicious hamburgers. And of course the best collection of Belgium Beers. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Fresh Elements <strong>&#36;&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;</span> | <em>International</em> | Breakfast, lunch or dinner? You can’t go wrong at Fresh Elements. It’s has a beautiful setup with a great atmosphere. </li>
          <br>
          <li>Little Windows Cafe <strong>&#36;</strong><span class="make_grey">&#36;&#36;</span> | <em>International</em> | Delicious food for a great price. Also one of the places with the best Wi-Fi in Pokhara. The sizzling fajitas are very popular. </li>

          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-piggy-bank"></span> Budget Tips</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Backpacking in Nepal is really cheap. But still it would be nice to save some money. Down below you can find a couple tips to save money in Pokhara. Want to know how much budget you need for backpacking in Nepal? Go visit our guide about the [budget you need for Nepal].</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>If you’re planning to paraglide in Pokhara it’s wise to ask around for prices. The price (included with video and photos) will be around $100. Most agencies and guesthouses will offer you this price but some will charge you more. </li>
            <br>
            <li>One of the cheapest ways to explore the Phewa Lake is by bicycle. For around $5 per day you can rent a bike and cycle around the lake. It’s a good way to escape the tourists and see the locals living their daily life.  </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
        </div>
        <div class="scrolladjust" id="gettingaround">
          <h1><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-road"></span> Getting around</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Once you're in Lakeside the easiest way to get around is by foot. But to get there can sometimes be a bit of a challenge. If you're coming from the airport or the bus stand the best way to go to Lakeside is by taxi. If you want to explore the lake the best way to get around is by bike.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Getting around by Bike</h4>
          <p>Everywhere in Lakeside you can find bicycle rental places. There's a lot of difference in quality between them so check your bikes first. Be prepared to have a sore buttocks for a couple days if you get a shitty bike. Usually it will cost you about $5 per day.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Getting around by Taxi</h4>
          <p>If you arrive by bus in Pokhara you will be harassed by loads of taxi drivers. Don’t go with the first one that approached you but ask around. Make clear where you want to go otherwise they take you to their ‘recommended’ hotel. From the Pokhara bus stand to Lakeside you will pay between Rs 300 – 400.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Duration from Lakeside to popular destinations:</p>
          <ul class="nodeco">
          <li>Lakeside Pokhara <span class="glyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span> Tourist bus stand <em>10 min</em></li>
          <li>Lakeside Pokhara <span class="glyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span> Pokhara Baglung Bus Park<em>10 min</em></li>
          <li>Lakeside Pokhara <span class="glyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span> World Peace Pagoda <em>30 min</em></li>
          <li>Lakeside Pokhara <span class="glyphicon glyphicon glyphicon-transfer"></span> Sarangkot <em>30 min</em></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
          <h4>Getting around by bus</h4>
          <p>It's possible to take local busses from Lakeside to the bus stands and the airport. It isn't really recommended though. It's a confusing and frustrating experience. But if you want to save money this will be your choice of transport. A ticket will cost you Rs 15.</p>
