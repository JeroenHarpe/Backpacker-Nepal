                Everywhere you look you can find some outstanding craftsmanship. This is the perfect place to start
                diving into the Newari culture. <p>

                Bhaktapur and of the highest buildings in the Kathmandu Valley. Nyatapola means five stories and you
                instantly can see why the Newari called it like this. Unfortunately it’s only possible to go into the
                temple once a year during the Dashain festival. At the top of the stairs you’ve a great view of
                Bhaktapur. </p>

                the 15th century and contains (funny) erotic carvings on the walls. You can recognize the temple by the
                pillar in front of the entrance.</p>

                go by. You will see hundreds (thousands) of pots drying on the square and women working on them. It’s
                not the most beautiful square in Bhaktapur but definitely one of the more interesting ones. </p>

          <p>Staying in Bhaktapur can be a magical experience. Most accommodations are in Newari style and that makes it
            a unique experience. The downside is that it’s a bit more expensive. There are no hostels in Bhaktapur. One
            night is enough to enjoy all the sceneries in Bhaktapur but it wouldn't hurt to stay longer.</p>

          <p>Backpacking in Nepal is really cheap. But still it would be nice to save some money. Down below you can
            find a couple tips to save money in Chitwan. Want to know how much budget you need for backpacking in Nepal?
            Go visit our guide about the [budget you need for Nepal].</p>

          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>The entry fee for Bhaktapur is very steep ($15). You only pay this fee once but if you’re staying longer
              than a week they write your passport number on the back of the ticket. Sometimes even if you’re staying
              for 2 days. Don’t throw away the ticket because there are several entrances gates where they check the
              ticket. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Accommodation in Bhaktapur is a lot more expensive than the rest of Nepal. If you’re really on a budget
              there are a couple very basic guesthouses that are under $10 a day. That’s about half the amount of the
              better guesthouses in Bhaktapur. </li>
